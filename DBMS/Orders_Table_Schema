* Purpose:               This is the database schema for the Orders table that is meant to store all of the orders taken. It is assumed that
*                        this table will have orders added to it through the use of the Place Order and Payment frames, and the information
*                        stored can be accessed or visualized through the use of the Graph Sales (Generate Reports) frame.
*
* Notes:
*    -This is in SQL language. I just didn't want to import anything incorrectly, so this is like a text file.
*    -This is a foreign key from the customer table.
